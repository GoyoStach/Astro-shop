description: "Orient model World Map RA-AA0E03L expands the line of popular watches in the Revival collection. The watch is a reinterpretation of the very popular sports style models from the 60s. Orient World Diver or Orient Dial Map. In the 1960s, several World Diver models appeared on the market that bore city markings around the perimeter of the dial, which, along with an internal 24-hour rotating lunette, made it possible to determine the time of the second selected time zone.The present reinterpretation is based on the watch known as the Orient World Diver Dial Map, introduced in 1969. It differed from the other models in the series in that the city names were replaced by world map. The modern edition delights with a faithful reproduction of the original dial. The case construction used, including the distinctive shape, proved very successful in the 1960s. The watch was equipped with an inner rotating lunette operated by a crown at the fourth hour position. The new version faithfully retains the elements of the original model, which are the world map dial, the internal rotating lunette with 24-hour markings, the crown at 4 o'clock, the cut-outs dividing the dial into world zones, and the proportions and shape of the case. The Orient World Map comes in four colours typical of the 1960s:blue, white, green and blue-orange (limited edition). The case of the Orient World Map RA-AA0E03L is made of stainless steel and houses the Orient F6922 mechanical movement with automatic winding. The machine has 22 stones, a running frequency of 21600 semi-rhythms per hour and a winding reserve of approximately 40 hours. It also has a stopping of the second hand when the watch is set (called hacking) and the possibility of manual winding.
In addition to the time display, the watch offers a date and day of the week display at position 3. The watch features a 24-hour internal rotating lunette, which allows the time to be determined at a selected location in the world using a dial with a world map and marked cities. The unusual dial depicting a world map is protected by a mineral glass. The internal rotating lunette can be operated by the crown at the 4 o'clock position. The luminescence used on the hands and inner rotating lunette ensures easier legibility in low light conditions. The water resistance of this model is 200 m, so the watch can withstand swimming. The Orient RA-AA0E03L comes on a solid steel bracelet and the 43.5mm case diameter makes it one of the larger watches in terms of size."
